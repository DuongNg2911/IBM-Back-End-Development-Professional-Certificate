## SDLC 
- SDLC is a systematic process to develop a software
- SDLC is a recursive process 

- Phases of SDLC

- Phase 1: Planning
  - When planning a software solution, the following factors must be considered: users of the solution the overall purpose of the solution, data inputs and outputs, legal and regulatory compliance, risk identification, quality assurance requirements, allocation of human and financial resources, and project scheduling.
  - All the factors should be documented in a file called SRS (Software Requirements Specification).

- Phrase 2: Design
  - Requirements are gathered from the SRS to develop architecture and documented into a design document, which will be used to assign the coding tasks.

- Phrase 3: Development
  - This is where the developers start the coding process once the design document is completed.

- Phrase 4: Testing
  - Once the coding is completed. Code is tested to ensure stability, security and that it meets requirements from the SRS.
  - Bugs reported, tracked, fixed, and retested until the software is stable.
  - There are four types of testing:
    - Unit Testing
    - Integration Testing
    - System Testing
    - User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
   
- Phrase 5: Deployment
  - Used for making software available on a website, mobile device app store , or a software distribution server on a corporate network

- Phrase 6: Maintenance
  - The maintenance phase happens once the code has been deployed into a production environment. This phase helps to find any other bugs, identify user interface issues, or UI for short, and identify other requirements that may not have been listed in the SRS.
  - If bugs are discovered in this phase that were missed during testing, these errors may need to be fixed for high-priority issues or incorporated into the requirements as part of a future software release and the process can start over again.

## Bulding Quality Software 
- Common software engineering processes
  - Requirements gathering: It may include a set of use cases, user flows that the software must implement. Software requirements can be classified into four broad categories (functional, external & user interface, non-functional, system features)
  - Design: Transforming requirements into code, application logic.
  - Coding for quality: Refers to the characteristics of the code including attributes such as maintainability, readability, testability, and security.

  - Testing
  - Releases
  - Documenting
