## Azure Virtual Machines
- What is Azure Virtual Network
  - Azure Virtual Network is a service that provides the fundamental building block for your private network in Azure which enables many types of resources to securely communicate with each other, the internet, and on-premises networks. These Azure resources include virtual machines (VMs). For example, you have 2 virtual machines, one hosting a web application, and one hosting the database, they can communicate with each other in a securely environment inside a virtual network.

  - You can also create a subnet, which means generate a virtual network for each virtual machine for better security. For example, you have 2 virtual machines, one hosting a web application, and one hosting the database, they can communicate with each other in the same virtual network but it only allows public internet traffic to access web application server without accessing database server.
